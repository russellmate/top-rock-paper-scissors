## What I learned
This was my first real Javascript project that was intened to put everything I have learned so far to the test. I learned a lot while working on this project, despite its small size, as I needed to figure out how to solve real programming problems, which is something that I had not done until now without explicit instruction. 

I correctly implemented loops, functions and DOM manipulation techniques for the first time in a real project here and am happy with how the end result turned out. The UI looks very basic as it was not my main concern here. I may revisit this and freshen the look up a bit in the future. 

## --new version

After returning to this project 9 months later, I have cleaned up the Javascript code and added a CSS file with more user friendly styling. I have also added a reset button to return the game to it's starting position.
